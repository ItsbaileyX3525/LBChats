# LBChats 

What is LBChats? Well LBChats is one of those really cool chatrooms where you can create channels, talk to others and play some sounds for you and your bros to hear.

LBChats stands for Leland and Bailey's chats as we are the people who made it! (Mostly me, check git commits >:( ./)

## Public channel

Chat with everyone that comes on the server, leave a message to immortalise yourself or chat with some of the active members, if there are any.

## Private channels

Feel the power of your own unmoderated chatrooms that follow your rules, anything you say goes in that chatroom of yours, I have no jurisdiction!

## Commands

The commands at the moment are very baseline, just /createInvite to create an invite code so that people can join your private server. And /playSound to play a sound effect to all that are in your server. Pick from the selected list or play your own sound effect using a direct https link! (Max 5s)

## All written in GO

using the fab language known as go this website was built mostly from the ground up with the help of GIN and GORM!
